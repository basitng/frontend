        are transformed and change for good. Here we established a Christ like

        where the love of God dwells. God has been faithful with this mandate,
        by doing great miracles through his Prophet: Sam Kayode. Giving sanity
        to the mentally impaired, healing the sick, bringing back the dead to
        life, transforming destiny and setting loose those in captivity of the
        devil. Indeed God has been Faithful.
